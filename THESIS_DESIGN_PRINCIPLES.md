# 3.2.4 Design Principles

## Overview

The SPA Management System is built on four key design principles that guide how the system is organized and operates. These principles ensure the system is reliable, maintainable, and scalable.

## The Four Design Principles

### Principle 1: Organized Structure

**What It Means**: The system separates different responsibilities into distinct parts that work independently.

**How the System Uses This**:
- **Data Storage**: Keeps all information about transactions, services, users, and payments
- **User Screens**: Shows information in a clear, easy-to-understand way
- **Processing Logic**: Handles business rules and coordinates between data and screens

**Why This Helps**:
- Changing the user interface doesn't affect how data is stored
- Business rules can be updated without redesigning screens
- Each part can be tested separately to ensure it works correctly

---

### Principle 2: Three-Layer Design

**What It Means**: The system is divided into three separate layers that can run on different computers.

**How the System Uses This**:
- **User Interface Layer**: Runs in web browsers (what users see and click)
- **Processing Layer**: Runs on the server (handles all business logic)
- **Database Layer**: Runs on the database server (stores all information)

**Why This Helps**:
- The system can handle more users by adding more servers
- Security is better because the database is isolated and protected
- Each layer can be upgraded or maintained without affecting the others

---

### Principle 3: Event-Driven Updates

**What It Means**: When something important happens, the system automatically tells everyone who needs to know.

**How the System Uses This**:
- **Events Are Created**: User actions (like claiming a customer) create events
- **Events Are Sent**: The system routes events to users who need to see them
- **Screens Update**: User interfaces automatically update when they receive events

**Why This Helps**:
- Users see changes instantly without refreshing their screens
- The system responds quickly to important actions
- Different parts don't need to constantly check for changes

**Example**: When a therapist claims a customer, all other therapists immediately see that customer removed from their queue.

### Principle 4: Layered Organization

**What It Means**: The system is organized in horizontal layers, where each layer only talks to the layers directly above and below it.

**How the System Uses This**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ User Interface Layer                    │ ← What users see
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Processing Layer                        │ ← Business rules
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Business Logic Layer                    │ ← Core validations
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Data Access Layer                       │ ← Data operations
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Database Layer                          │ ← Physical storage
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why This Helps**:
- Each layer can be maintained and updated separately
- Layers can be tested independently
- Technical details are hidden from upper layers
- Technology can be changed in one layer without breaking others

---

## Summary

These four design principles work together to create a system that is:

1. **Well-Organized**: Each part has a clear purpose and responsibility
2. **Scalable**: Can grow to handle more users and transactions
3. **Responsive**: Updates happen instantly across all users
4. **Maintainable**: Changes can be made to one part without breaking others

By following these principles, the SPA Management System provides a reliable and efficient solution for managing spa operations while supporting multiple users working simultaneously.
