- Version: 3.0.3
- Architecture: Micro-framework with modular extensions
- Request Handling: WSGI-compliant (PEP 3333)
- Routing: Werkzeug-based URL routing

**Justification:**
Flask was chosen over Django because the Spa Management System requires moderate complexity that does not necessitate Django's built-in admin panel, authentication system, and ORM. Flask's blueprint pattern enables modular architecture, separating concerns by user role (customer, therapist, cashier, monitor), which directly aligns with the system's multi-actor design. The framework's extensive documentation and active community support ensure long-term maintainability.

**Integration:**
Flask integrates seamlessly with SQLAlchemy for database operations and Flask-SocketIO for real-time communication, creating a cohesive technology stack.

#### 3.X.1.3 Flask-SocketIO 5.3.6

Flask-SocketIO enables bidirectional, event-based communication between the server and clients through the WebSocket protocol with automatic fallback to HTTP long-polling.
