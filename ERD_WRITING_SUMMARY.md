## ‚ö° Quick Start Instructions

### Step 1: Review Tips (15 min)
Read `ERD_SECTION_TIPS_AND_TEMPLATE.md` to understand:
- Academic writing style
- Entity description format
- Relationship description format

### Step 2: Customize Content (2 hours)
1. Copy content from PART1 and PART2 files
2. Add your actual ERD diagram from `erd_clean.md` after section 3.5.1
3. Review each entity description - adjust if needed
4. Add example data tables where helpful
5. Complete the remaining relationships (I provided templates)

### Step 3: Add Missing Sections (45 min)
Complete these final subsections:

**3.5.4 Normalization Analysis** (~¬Ω page)
```
The database schema adheres to Third Normal Form (3NF):

**First Normal Form (1NF):**
- All attributes contain atomic values (no arrays)
- No repeating groups (services stored as separate TransactionItem records)
- Each table has primary key

**Second Normal Form (2NF):**
- All non-key attributes depend on entire primary key
- ServiceClassification separated from Service
- TransactionItem stores denormalized price/duration for historical accuracy

**Third Normal Form (3NF):**
- No transitive dependencies
- ServiceCategory separated from Service
- Therapist/Cashier information not duplicated in Transaction

**Controlled Denormalization:**
TransactionItem intentionally stores price and duration_minutes...
[Explain why this is necessary - see PART2 file]
```

**3.5.5 Integrity Constraints** (~¬Ω page)
```
**Entity Integrity:**
- All tables have PRIMARY KEY (auto-incrementing integers)
- Primary keys cannot be NULL

**Referential Integrity:**
- FOREIGN KEY constraints enforce valid relationships
- CASCADE DELETE: Service ‚Üí ServiceClassification
- SET NULL: Service ‚Üí TransactionItem (preserves history)
- RESTRICT: Therapist with transactions cannot be deleted

**Domain Integrity:**
- ENUM for Transaction.status (8 valid states only)
- BOOLEAN for Therapist.active, Cashier.active
- NOT NULL on critical fields (username, password_hash, price)

**User-Defined Integrity:**
- UNIQUE constraints: Transaction.code, Therapist.username
- Application-level validation: amount_paid >= amount_due
```

### Step 4: Final Review (30 min)
Use the quality checklist in TIPS file

## üéØ Key Points to Emphasize

### 1. **Denormalization Justification** (Critical!)
Your TransactionItem stores price/duration redundantly. This is GOOD and necessary:
```
"While this violates strict 3NF, it preserves historical pricing accuracy.
When service prices change, past transactions show original prices, 
not current prices - essential for financial auditing."
```

### 2. **Transaction Status Workflow**
Explain the 8-state ENUM:
```
selecting ‚Üí pending_therapist ‚Üí therapist_confirmed ‚Üí in_service ‚Üí 
finished ‚Üí awaiting_payment ‚Üí paying ‚Üí paid
```

### 3. **Security Measures**
Emphasize password hashing in Therapist and Cashier:
```
"password_hash uses PBKDF2-SHA256 algorithm with salt, 
meeting OWASP security guidelines. Plain-text passwords 
never stored in database."
```

### 4. **Concurrency Control**
Explain row-level locking:
```
"SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED prevents race conditions
when multiple therapists simultaneously claim customers."
```

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Start with Simple Entities
Write in this order:
1. TransactionCounter (simplest - singleton)
2. ServiceCategory (simple - 2 attributes)
3. Service (moderate - 4 attributes)
4. ServiceClassification (moderate - 5 attributes)
5. Therapist/Cashier (complex - 8 attributes)
6. Transaction (most complex - 17 attributes!)
7. TransactionItem, Payment, Room (moderate)

### Tip 2: Use Examples Liberally
Example data tables help readers understand:
```
| id | code | status | total_amount |
|----|------|--------|--------------|
| 1  | 0001 | paid   | 1200.00      |
```

### Tip 3: Explain Business Rules
Don't just list constraints - explain WHY:
‚ùå "Username is UNIQUE"
‚úÖ "Username has UNIQUE constraint to prevent authentication conflicts when multiple therapists attempt login"

### Tip 4: Reference Other Sections
Connect to your architecture section:
"As described in Section 3.3.4, row-level locking prevents concurrent access conflicts..."
