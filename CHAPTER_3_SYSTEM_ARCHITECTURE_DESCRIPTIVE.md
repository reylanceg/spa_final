# CHAPTER 3: METHODOLOGY
## 3.3 System Architecture

### 3.3.1 Overview

The SPA Management System employs a three-tier client-server architecture with real-time communication capabilities, designed to facilitate concurrent multi-role operations in a spa environment. The architecture integrates a presentation layer, business logic layer, and data persistence layer, interconnected through a bidirectional event-driven communication framework. This architectural approach addresses the critical requirement of maintaining synchronized state across customer, therapist, cashier, and monitor interfaces in a concurrent operational environment.

The system architecture is fundamentally built upon the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, enhanced with WebSocket-based real-time communication. This enhancement enables instantaneous updates across all connected clients without requiring page refreshes, which is essential for maintaining operational efficiency in a dynamic spa environment where multiple actors interact simultaneously with the system. The architectural design ensures that when a customer selects services, therapists immediately see the update in their queue; when a therapist completes a service, cashiers are instantly notified; and when any transaction state changes, the monitoring dashboard reflects these changes in real-time.

### 3.3.2 Architectural Pattern

#### 3.3.2.1 Three-Tier Architecture

The system implements a classical three-tier architecture, which provides clear separation of concerns and enables independent scaling of each layer. The first tier, the Presentation Layer (Client Tier), is responsible for user interface rendering and client-side interaction handling. This layer is implemented using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), along with the Socket.IO Client library for real-time communication. The presentation layer encompasses multiple specialized interfaces tailored to different user roles: customer service selection interfaces accessible through `services1.html` and `services2.html`, a therapist queue management dashboard implemented in `therapist.html`, a cashier payment processing interface in `cashier.html`, a real-time monitoring dashboard in `monitor.html`, and authentication interfaces for therapists and cashiers through `login_therapist.html` and `login_cashier.html` respectively.

The second tier, the Application Layer (Business Logic Tier), serves as the core processing engine of the system. Built on Python 3.10+ with Flask 3.0.3 and Flask-SocketIO 5.3.6, this layer handles all business logic processing, request routing, and real-time event handling. The application layer is structured using Flask's application factory pattern, implemented in `app/__init__.py`, which initializes the application with proper configuration, database connections, and Socket.IO setup. The business logic is organized into blueprint-based route handlers located in the `routes/` directory, with each blueprint handling specific user role functionality. Socket.IO event handlers, centralized in `socketio_events.py`, manage all real-time communication events. Authentication middleware, implemented in `utils/auth_helpers.py`, ensures secure access control across all protected routes. The business logic encompasses queue management algorithms, service allocation mechanisms, and payment processing workflows.

The third tier, the Data Layer (Persistence Tier), ensures reliable data storage and retrieval. This layer utilizes MySQL Database as the primary data store, with SQLAlchemy 2.0.31 serving as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework and PyMySQL 1.1.1 providing the database connectivity. The data layer implements a relational database schema consisting of 10 normalized tables, all defined through SQLAlchemy ORM models in `models.py`. Database connection pooling optimizes resource utilization, while session management ensures proper transaction handling. All database operations adhere to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) principles, which is particularly critical for payment processing where data integrity cannot be compromised.

#### 3.3.2.2 MVC Pattern Implementation

The system strictly adheres to the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern, which provides a clear separation between data representation, user interface, and business logic. The Models, defined in `app/models.py`, represent the core business domain objects and database entities. These include `Transaction`, `Service`, `Therapist`, `Cashier`, `Payment`, and their related entities. Each model encapsulates not only the data structure but also data validation rules, relationship management logic, and domain-specific methods that operate on the data. For instance, the `Transaction` model includes methods for calculating total amounts, validating status transitions, and managing the transaction lifecycle.

The Views component utilizes the Jinja2 template engine to render server-side HTML with dynamic content injection. All templates are located in the `app/templates/` directory and follow a hierarchical structure through template inheritance. The base template, `base.html`, defines the common layout structure including headers, navigation elements, and footer components, ensuring visual consistency across all pages. Child templates extend this base template and inject role-specific content into designated blocks, significantly reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.

The Controllers are implemented as blueprint-based route handlers in the `app/routes/` directory. Each blueprint corresponds to a specific functional area or user role within the system. The Customer Blueprint, implemented in `customer.py`, handles service browsing and selection workflows. The Therapist Blueprint in `therapist.py` manages queue operations, service confirmation, and service delivery tracking. The Cashier Blueprint in `cashier.py` processes payments and finalizes transactions. The Monitor Blueprint, split across `monitor.py` and `monitor_snapshot.py`, provides real-time dashboard functionality with system-wide statistics. Finally, the Authentication Blueprint in `auth.py` handles login, logout, and token-based authentication for all user roles. Each controller processes incoming HTTP requests, invokes appropriate business logic, interacts with models to retrieve or persist data, and returns responses either as rendered HTML pages or JSON data for AJAX requests.

### 3.3.3 System Components

#### 3.3.3.1 Core Application Components

The Application Factory, implemented in `app/__init__.py`, serves as the initialization point for the entire Flask application. This component follows the factory pattern, which provides flexibility in creating multiple application instances with different configurationsâ€”particularly useful for testing and deployment scenarios. The factory's primary responsibilities include loading configuration from environment variables (such as database connection strings and secret keys), establishing database connections through SQLAlchemy, initializing Socket.IO with appropriate CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration to allow WebSocket connections from the frontend, registering all blueprints for modular routing, and creating database schemas through SQLAlchemy's metadata creation mechanism.

The Database Models component, centralized in `app/models.py`, defines the complete data model consisting of 10 interconnected entities. The `ServiceCategory` entity provides service categorization functionality and maintains a one-to-many relationship with the `Service` entity. The `Service` entity defines individual service offerings and connects to both `ServiceClassification` (for pricing tiers) and `TransactionItem` (for transaction line items) through one-to-many relationships. The `ServiceClassification` entity enables flexible pricing by allowing multiple price points for the same service based on classification levels, maintaining a many-to-one relationship back to `Service`. The `Therapist` entity stores therapist account information and credentials, linking to multiple transactions through a one-to-many relationship. Similarly, the `Cashier` entity manages cashier accounts and maintains one-to-many relationships with both `Transaction` and `Payment` entities. The `Transaction` entity serves as the central hub of the system, representing customer transactions and maintaining relationships with multiple entities: one-to-many with `TransactionItem` (allowing multiple services per transaction), one-to-one with `Payment` (each transaction has exactly one payment record), many-to-one with `Therapist` (assigned therapist), many-to-one with `Cashier` (assigned cashier), and one-to-one with `Room` (assigned treatment room). The `TransactionItem` entity represents individual service line items within a transaction, maintaining many-to-one relationships with both `Transaction` and `Service`. The `Payment` entity records payment information and maintains a one-to-one relationship with `Transaction`. The `Room` entity manages treatment room availability and assignment, maintaining a one-to-one relationship with active transactions. Finally, the `TransactionCounter` entity implements a singleton pattern to generate sequential, unique transaction codes in a thread-safe manner.

The Route Blueprints component organizes the application's functionality into modular, role-based units. The Customer Blueprint handles all customer-facing functionality, including service browsing, service detail viewing, shopping cart management, and service selection confirmation. The Therapist Blueprint manages the complete therapist workflow, from viewing the pending customer queue to confirming the next customer, starting service delivery, adding or removing services during treatment, and marking services as complete. The Cashier Blueprint handles the payment workflow, including viewing the payment queue, claiming the next transaction, entering payment amounts, calculating change, and finalizing transactions. The Monitor Blueprint provides comprehensive real-time monitoring capabilities, displaying system-wide statistics such as active transactions, completed transactions, revenue metrics, and queue lengths. The Authentication Blueprint manages user authentication for both therapists and cashiers, handling login requests, credential validation, token generation, session management, and logout functionality.

The Socket.IO Event Handlers component, implemented in `socketio_events.py`, manages all real-time bidirectional communication between the server and connected clients. When a customer confirms their service selection, the `customer_confirm_selection` event is triggered, which creates a new transaction in the database and broadcasts an update to both the `therapist_queue` room (so therapists see the new customer) and the `monitor` room (so the dashboard reflects the new transaction). When a therapist confirms they will serve the next customer, the `therapist_confirm_next` event acquires a row-level lock on the next pending transaction, assigns the therapist and an available room, updates the transaction status, and broadcasts updates to all therapists and the monitor. When a therapist starts service delivery, the `therapist_start_service` event updates the transaction status and notifies the monitor. During service delivery, therapists can trigger `therapist_add_service` to add additional services or `therapist_remove_item` to remove services, with each action updating the transaction and broadcasting changes. When service is complete, the `therapist_finish_service` event moves the transaction to the payment queue and broadcasts to both the `cashier_queue` room and the `monitor` room. Cashiers trigger `cashier_claim_next` to claim the next transaction awaiting payment, which locks the transaction and assigns the cashier. Finally, the `cashier_pay` event processes the payment, creates a payment record, marks the transaction as paid, and broadcasts completion notifications.

### 3.3.4 Data Flow Architecture

#### 3.3.4.1 Request-Response Flow (HTTP)

The traditional HTTP request-response cycle handles page rendering and form submissions through a well-defined sequence of operations. When a client browser initiates an HTTP request, the request is received by the Flask route handler corresponding to the requested URL. The route handler delegates processing to the appropriate business logic layer, which determines what data needs to be retrieved from the database. The business logic layer invokes SQLAlchemy ORM methods to construct and execute database queries. These queries are translated into SQL statements and sent to the MySQL database. The database processes the query and returns the results to the ORM layer. SQLAlchemy then maps the raw database results into Python objects according to the model definitions. These mapped objects are passed back to the business logic layer, which may perform additional processing, calculations, or transformations. The processed data is then passed to the Jinja2 template engine along with the appropriate template file. Jinja2 renders the template by injecting the dynamic data into the HTML structure, applying any template logic, and escaping potentially dangerous content to prevent XSS attacks. The rendered HTML is returned to the Flask route handler, which constructs an HTTP response with appropriate headers and status codes. Finally, the HTTP response is sent back to the client browser, which renders the HTML for the user.

#### 3.3.4.2 Real-Time Event Flow (WebSocket)

The bidirectional event-driven communication system enables real-time state synchronization across all connected clients through WebSocket connections. When a user performs an action that requires real-time updates, the client-side JavaScript captures this action and prepares event data. The Socket.IO client library emits a named event with the associated data payload through the established WebSocket connection. The WebSocket connection carries this event to the server, where the Flask-SocketIO handler receives it. The Socket.IO event handler on the server side processes the event by invoking appropriate business logic. This business logic typically involves database operations to persist the state change. Once the database operation completes successfully, the business logic prepares update data to broadcast to other clients. The Socket.IO handler then emits events to specific rooms based on which clients need to be notified. Connected clients in these rooms receive the broadcast event through their WebSocket connections. The client-side JavaScript event handlers receive these events and update the Document Object Model accordingly, reflecting the state change in the user interface without requiring a page refresh. The initiating client also receives an acknowledgment or response, confirming that their action was processed successfully.

#### 3.3.4.3 Concurrency Control

The system implements pessimistic locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions in scenarios where multiple users might attempt to claim the same resource simultaneously. This is particularly critical in the therapist and cashier queue claiming operations. The concurrency control strategy employs SQLAlchemy's `with_for_update()` method combined with the `skip_locked=True` parameter. When a therapist attempts to claim the next customer, the system constructs a query that filters transactions by status, orders them by confirmation timestamp, and applies `with_for_update(skip_locked=True)`. This query acquires a row-level lock on the first matching transaction, preventing any other database session from reading or modifying that row until the transaction commits. The `skip_locked=True` parameter instructs the database to skip over any rows that are already locked by other sessions, preventing deadlocks and ensuring that if two therapists click simultaneously, one will lock the first transaction while the other will automatically receive the second transaction in the queue.

---

### 3.3.5 Communication Architecture

#### 3.3.5.1 WebSocket Communication Layer

The WebSocket communication layer provides the foundation for real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and all connected clients. The server-side implementation utilizes Flask-SocketIO version 5.3.6, which runs on top of the Eventlet 0.35.2 asynchronous framework. Eventlet's async mode enables the server to handle thousands of concurrent WebSocket connections efficiently through non-blocking I/O operations. The client-side implementation uses the Socket.IO JavaScript client library, which provides a high-level API for WebSocket communication with automatic fallback mechanisms. The underlying protocol is WebSocket as defined in RFC 6455, which provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. However, Socket.IO includes automatic fallback to HTTP long-polling for environments where WebSocket connections are blocked by firewalls or proxies, ensuring maximum compatibility.

Connection management is handled automatically by the Socket.IO library on both client and server sides. When a client page loads, the Socket.IO client establishes a persistent bidirectional connection to the server. This connection remains open for the duration of the user's session, allowing both the client and server to send messages at any time without the overhead of establishing new connections. If the connection is lost due to network issues or server restarts, the Socket.IO client automatically attempts to reconnect using an exponential backoff strategy, starting with short intervals and gradually increasing the wait time between attempts. A heartbeat mechanism continuously monitors connection health, with both client and server sending periodic ping/pong messages to detect connection failures quickly. When the connection is successfully re-established, the client automatically re-subscribes to any rooms it was previously in, ensuring continuity of real-time updates.

The room architecture provides a mechanism for targeted message delivery, ensuring that updates are only sent to clients that need them. Rooms are logical groupings of connected clients, and a single client can join multiple rooms simultaneously. The `therapist_queue` room includes all connected therapist clients, ensuring they receive updates whenever a new customer selects services or when the queue state changes. The `cashier_queue` room includes all connected cashier clients, who receive notifications when services are completed and transactions move to the payment queue. The `monitor` room includes monitoring dashboard clients, which receive all system-wide events to maintain comprehensive real-time statistics. Additionally, per-transaction rooms follow the naming pattern `txn_{transaction_id}`, allowing targeted updates to be sent to specific customers about their transaction status. This room-based architecture minimizes network traffic by ensuring clients only receive relevant updates, rather than broadcasting all events to all clients.

### 3.3.6 Database Architecture

#### 3.3.6.1 Schema Design

The database schema adheres to Third Normal Form (3NF) principles, which eliminate data redundancy and ensure data integrity through proper normalization. Third Normal Form requires that all non-key attributes depend solely on the primary key and not on other non-key attributes, preventing update anomalies and maintaining consistency.

The entity-relationship structure reflects the business domain of spa management. The `ServiceCategory` entity serves as the top-level organizational unit for services, with attributes including a primary key identifier, category name, and descriptive text. Each service category can contain multiple services, establishing a one-to-many relationship with the `Service` entity. The `Service` entity represents individual service offerings such as massages, facials, or body treatments. Each service record includes a primary key, foreign key reference to its category, service name, detailed description, and an image URL for visual presentation. Services can have multiple pricing tiers through the `ServiceClassification` entity, which implements a one-to-many relationship from `Service`. This design allows a single service to have multiple classifications with different prices and durations. The `ServiceClassification` entity stores the classification name, price as a decimal value, and duration in minutes.

The `Therapist` and `Cashier` entities manage staff accounts with similar structures. Both include a primary key identifier, unique username for login, password hash for secure authentication, display name for the user interface, authentication token for session management, and an active boolean flag for soft deletion. The unique constraints on username and authentication token ensure that no two users can have the same credentials and that session tokens are globally unique.

The `Transaction` entity serves as the central hub connecting customers, services, staff, and payments. Each transaction includes a primary key, a unique four-digit code for customer reference, foreign keys to the assigned therapist and cashier, a foreign key to the assigned room, an enumerated status field tracking the transaction lifecycle, the total amount as a decimal value, and multiple timestamp fields capturing the transaction's progression through the system. These timestamps provide a complete audit trail and enable performance analytics such as average wait times and service durations.

The `TransactionItem` entity implements the line items for each transaction, allowing a single transaction to include multiple services. This entity includes a primary key, foreign keys to both the transaction and the service, and denormalized fields for service name, classification, price, and duration. The denormalization is intentional and serves an important purpose: it preserves the exact service details as they were at the time of purchase. If service prices or names change in the future, historical transaction records remain accurate and reflect what the customer actually purchased and paid for.

The `Payment` entity records payment information with a one-to-one relationship to transactions. Each payment record includes the transaction reference, the cashier who processed the payment, the amount paid by the customer, the change amount returned, and the timestamp of payment completion. The `Room` entity manages treatment room availability with a simple structure including a room identifier, unique room name, and availability boolean flag. Finally, the `TransactionCounter` entity implements a singleton pattern with a single row that stores the last used transaction code number, enabling thread-safe generation of sequential transaction codes.

#### 3.3.6.2 Data Integrity Mechanisms

The database schema employs multiple layers of integrity mechanisms to ensure data consistency and prevent invalid states. Foreign key constraints enforce referential integrity between related entities, ensuring that a transaction cannot reference a non-existent therapist, cashier, or room. These constraints are configured with appropriate cascade behaviors, such that deleting a transaction automatically deletes all associated transaction items, preventing orphaned records that would waste storage and potentially cause application errors.

Unique constraints prevent duplicate data where uniqueness is required. The `Transaction.code` unique constraint ensures that each transaction has a globally unique identifier that can be displayed to customers without confusion. The `Therapist.username` and `Cashier.username` unique constraints prevent duplicate accounts and ensure that each username maps to exactly one user. The `Therapist.auth_token` and `Cashier.auth_token` unique constraints ensure that authentication tokens are globally unique, preventing session hijacking scenarios where two users might share the same token.

Enumerated types provide type safety at the database level. The `TransactionStatus` enumeration defines the valid status values and prevents invalid status values from being stored. This constraint ensures that the application cannot accidentally set a transaction to an undefined status, which could break business logic that depends on status values.

ACID compliance ensures that all database operations maintain data consistency even in the face of concurrent access, system failures, or application errors. Atomicity guarantees that database transactions either complete entirely or have no effect at all. Consistency ensures that all database constraints are enforced before any transaction commits, preventing invalid data from ever being persisted. Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. Durability guarantees that once a transaction commits, the data is permanently stored even if the system crashes immediately afterward. MySQL's InnoDB storage engine achieves this through write-ahead logging and periodic checkpointing to disk.

### 3.3.7 Security Architecture

#### 3.3.7.1 Authentication and Authorization

Password security is implemented using industry-standard cryptographic hashing algorithms. When a therapist or cashier account is created, their password is processed through Werkzeug's `generate_password_hash()` function, which implements a bcrypt-compatible algorithm. This algorithm automatically generates a random salt for each password, combines it with the password, and applies a computationally expensive hashing function multiple times. The resulting hash is stored in the database, but the original password is never stored in any form. This approach ensures that even if an attacker gains access to the database, they cannot recover the original passwords. When a user attempts to log in, their entered password is processed through the `check_password_hash()` function, which extracts the salt from the stored hash, applies the same hashing process to the entered password, and compares the results using a constant-time comparison algorithm to prevent timing attacks.

Token-based authentication manages user sessions after successful login. When a therapist or cashier successfully authenticates, the system generates a unique session token and stores it in both the database (associated with the user's account) and the client's browser (in SessionStorage). For all subsequent requests to protected routes, the client includes this token in the request headers. The server validates the token by checking if it exists in the database and is associated with an active account. This approach provides several advantages over traditional session cookies: tokens can be easily invalidated by removing them from the database, tokens can have explicit expiration times, and tokens can be used across different domains if needed for future mobile applications.

Role-based access control (RBAC) ensures that users can only access functionality appropriate to their role. The system maintains separate authentication systems for therapists and cashiers, with distinct login pages, token storage, and protected routes. Authentication decorators are applied to route handlers, checking the user's role before allowing access. Socket.IO event handlers also validate user roles before processing events, ensuring that a customer cannot emit therapist-only events or that a therapist cannot process payments.

#### 3.3.7.2 Input Validation and Sanitization

SQL injection prevention is achieved through SQLAlchemy's ORM layer, which exclusively uses parameterized queries. When the application needs to query the database with user-provided input, the ORM constructs a query with placeholders for the user input and sends the query structure and data separately to the database. The database driver then safely combines them, ensuring that user input is always treated as data rather than executable SQL code. This approach completely eliminates SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) prevention is implemented through Jinja2's automatic escaping feature. When rendering templates, Jinja2 automatically escapes HTML special characters in any dynamic content, converting them to their HTML entity equivalents. This ensures that if a user somehow manages to inject JavaScript code into data fields, the code will be displayed as text rather than executed by the browser. The MarkupSafe library, which Jinja2 depends on, provides the underlying safe string handling mechanisms.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection is implemented through Flask's session cookie signing mechanism. Flask uses a secret key stored securely in environment variables to cryptographically sign session cookies using the itsdangerous library. This signature proves that the cookie was issued by the legitimate server and has not been tampered with. When a request is received with a session cookie, Flask verifies the signature before trusting the session data. This prevents attackers from crafting malicious requests that appear to come from legitimate users, as they cannot generate valid signatures without knowing the secret key.

### 3.3.8 Performance Optimization

#### 3.3.8.1 Asynchronous Processing

The Eventlet concurrency model provides the foundation for efficient handling of multiple concurrent connections. Traditional threaded servers create a new operating system thread for each connection, which incurs significant memory overhead and context-switching costs. Eventlet instead uses greenlets, which are lightweight coroutines that exist entirely in user space. Each greenlet consumes only about 1KB of memory, allowing the server to maintain thousands of concurrent connections on modest hardware. Eventlet implements cooperative multitasking, where greenlets voluntarily yield control when they perform I/O operations. This approach is particularly effective for I/O-bound applications like web servers, where most time is spent waiting for external resources rather than performing CPU-intensive computations. When a greenlet performs a database query, it yields control, allowing other greenlets to process their requests. When the database query completes, the original greenlet resumes execution. This efficient context switching enables high concurrency without the overhead of operating system thread management.

#### 3.3.8.2 Database Optimization

Connection pooling significantly improves database performance by reusing database connections rather than creating new ones for each request. Establishing a new database connection involves network overhead, authentication, and initialization, which can take tens of milliseconds. SQLAlchemy maintains a pool of pre-established connections to the MySQL database. When a request needs database access, it borrows a connection from the pool, uses it for its queries, and returns it to the pool when done. This eliminates the connection establishment overhead for most requests, reducing latency and improving throughput.

Query optimization is achieved through several mechanisms. Selective column loading retrieves only the columns actually needed by the application, reducing data transfer between the database and application server. Relationship lazy loading defers loading of related entities until they are actually accessed, preventing unnecessary queries for data that might not be used. Database indexes on primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints enable the database to locate rows quickly without scanning entire tables.

Transaction batching groups multiple database operations into single transactions, reducing the number of round-trips to the database. For example, when a customer confirms their service selection, the application creates a Transaction record and multiple TransactionItem records in a single database transaction. This approach is more efficient than committing each record individually and provides atomicity guarantees.

#### 3.3.8.3 Client-Side Optimization

LocalStorage caching reduces server requests by persisting the customer shopping cart in the browser's local storage. When a customer adds services to their cart, the cart data is stored locally rather than being sent to the server immediately. This allows customers to browse services, add and remove items, and see their cart total without any network requests. Only when the customer confirms their selection is the cart data sent to the server. This approach reduces server load, improves responsiveness, and allows the cart to persist even if the customer closes and reopens their browser.

SessionStorage for authentication tokens reduces database lookups for authenticated requests. When a therapist or cashier logs in, their authentication token is stored in SessionStorage. For subsequent requests, the client includes this token in request headers, allowing the server to validate the token efficiently.

Efficient DOM updates minimize browser rendering overhead. When real-time updates are received via Socket.IO, the JavaScript code updates only the specific DOM elements that changed, rather than re-rendering entire sections of the page. This approach reduces CPU usage, prevents visual flickering, and maintains scroll positions and other user interface state.
