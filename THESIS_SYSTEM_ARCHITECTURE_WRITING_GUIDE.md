## Introduction

### What is System Architecture in a Thesis?

The **System Architecture** section of your thesis demonstrates your understanding of how different components of your system interact, communicate, and work together to achieve the project objectives. It is a critical part of Chapter 3 (Methodology) that bridges the gap between your theoretical framework and actual implementation.

### Why is it Important?

1. **Demonstrates Technical Depth**: Shows evaluators you understand complex system design
2. **Validates Design Decisions**: Justifies why specific technologies and patterns were chosen
3. **Proves Feasibility**: Establishes that your approach is technically sound
4. **Enables Replication**: Provides sufficient detail for others to understand and potentially replicate your work
5. **Academic Rigor**: Showcases systematic thinking and professional software engineering practices

---

## Structure and Organization

### Recommended Section Hierarchy

A well-structured System Architecture section follows a **top-down approach**: start with high-level overview, then progressively drill down into details.

#### Level 1: Overview (Big Picture)
- High-level architectural pattern (e.g., Three-tier, Microservices, MVC)
- System context and boundaries
- Major stakeholders and interfaces

#### Level 2: Architectural Pattern
- Specific pattern identification (MVC, MVP, MVVM, etc.)
- Pattern diagram
- How your system implements this pattern

#### Level 3: System Components
- Individual components and their responsibilities
- Component relationships and dependencies
- Technology stack for each component

#### Level 4: Data Flow and Communication
- Request-response cycles
- Data transformation and validation
- Communication protocols (HTTP, WebSocket, gRPC, etc.)

#### Level 5: Supporting Architectures
- Database architecture and schema design
- Security architecture
- Performance optimization strategies

#### Level 6: Integration and Workflows
- End-to-end workflows
- Integration between components
- State management

---

## Writing Tips and Best Practices

### 1. Start with a Strong Overview

**Good Example:**
> "The SPA Management System employs a **three-tier client-server architecture** with real-time communication capabilities, designed to facilitate concurrent multi-role operations in a spa environment. The architecture integrates a presentation layer, business logic layer, and data persistence layer, interconnected through a bidirectional event-driven communication framework."

**Why This Works:**
- Immediately identifies the architectural pattern
- States the purpose/context
- Mentions key distinguishing features (real-time, multi-role)
- Uses precise technical terminology

**Poor Example:**
> "The system has a frontend and backend that talk to each other."

**Why This Fails:**
- Vague and informal language
- No specific architectural pattern identified
- Lacks technical depth
- Doesn't convey system complexity

---

### 2. Use Formal Academic Language

| ❌ Avoid | ✅ Use Instead |
|---------|---------------|
| "talks to" | communicates with, interfaces with, exchanges data with |
| "handles" | processes, manages, executes |
| "stuff" | data, information, resources, components |
| "makes sure" | ensures, guarantees, validates |
| "gets" | retrieves, fetches, obtains |
| "sends" | transmits, dispatches, emits |
| "big" | extensive, comprehensive, substantial |
| "fast" | efficient, performant, optimized |

---

### 3. Always Justify Design Decisions

**Template for Justification:**
```
[Technology/Pattern Name] was selected because:
1. [Primary technical reason]
2. [Secondary reason related to requirements]
3. [Advantage over alternatives]
```

**Example:**
> "Flask-SocketIO was selected because: (1) it provides seamless integration with the Flask framework without requiring separate server infrastructure, (2) it enables real-time bidirectional communication essential for queue synchronization across multiple user roles, and (3) it offers automatic fallback mechanisms to long-polling when WebSocket connections are unavailable, ensuring reliability."

---

### 4. Define Before You Use

**Rule**: The first time you introduce a technical term, pattern, or acronym, provide a brief definition or explanation.

**Good Example:**
> "The system implements the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern, a design pattern that separates application logic into three interconnected components: Models (data and business logic), Views (user interface presentation), and Controllers (input handling and flow control)."

**Poor Example:**
> "The system uses MVC."

---

### 5. Show Then Explain Pattern

For every diagram you include:

1. **Introduce** what the diagram represents
2. **Show** the diagram
3. **Explain** the key elements and relationships
4. **Relate** it back to your system's requirements

**Example:**
```markdown
#### 3.3.4 Data Flow Architecture

The following sequence diagram illustrates the request-response cycle for 
traditional HTTP requests in the system:

[DIAGRAM HERE]

As shown in the diagram, when a client browser initiates an HTTP request (1), 
the Flask route handler processes the request (2) and invokes the appropriate 
business logic (3). The business logic layer queries the database through the 
SQLAlchemy ORM (4-6), which returns mapped objects (7). Finally, the Jinja2 
template engine renders the response HTML (8), which is returned to the client 
(9). This architecture ensures separation of concerns and maintains the MVC 
pattern throughout the request lifecycle.
```

---

### 6. Use Tables for Comparative Information

Tables are excellent for presenting structured information clearly.

**Good Use Cases:**
- Component responsibilities
- Technology stack comparison
- Database entities and relationships
- Event handlers and their purposes

**Example:**
```markdown
| Component | Technology | Purpose | Key Features |
|-----------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Presentation Layer | HTML5, JavaScript, Socket.IO | User interface | Real-time updates, responsive design |
| Application Layer | Flask, Flask-SocketIO | Business logic | Request routing, event handling |
| Data Layer | MySQL, SQLAlchemy | Persistence | ACID compliance, ORM mapping |
```

---

### 7. Document Concurrency and State Management

For systems with concurrent operations, explicitly address:
- How race conditions are prevented
- Locking mechanisms (optimistic vs pessimistic)
- Transaction isolation levels
- State synchronization strategies

**Example:**
> "The system implements pessimistic locking using SQLAlchemy's `with_for_update()` clause combined with the `skip_locked=True` parameter. This approach acquires row-level locks on transactions being claimed by therapists or cashiers, while the skip_locked parameter ensures that competing processes automatically skip locked rows rather than blocking, thereby preventing deadlocks in high-concurrency scenarios."

---

### 8. Address Non-Functional Requirements

Don't just describe WHAT the architecture does; explain HOW it addresses:

- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Performance**: Optimization strategies, caching, connection pooling
- **Scalability**: How the system can grow to handle more load
- **Reliability**: Error handling, fault tolerance
- **Maintainability**: Code organization, separation of concerns

---

### 9. Include Code Snippets Sparingly

Only include code snippets when they:
1. Illustrate a critical architectural concept
2. Show implementation of a complex pattern
3. Demonstrate a unique or innovative solution

**Guidelines:**
- Keep snippets short (5-15 lines maximum)
- Add comments explaining key lines
- Use proper syntax highlighting
- Always explain the snippet in text before showing it

**Example:**
```markdown
The following Python code demonstrates the row-level locking mechanism:

```python
# Acquire exclusive lock on next available transaction
transaction = Transaction.query \
    .filter_by(status=TransactionStatus.pending_therapist) \
    .order_by(Transaction.selection_confirmed_at.asc()) \
    .with_for_update(skip_locked=True) \  # Row-level lock
    .first()
```

The `with_for_update()` method acquires a database lock, while `skip_locked=True` 
prevents blocking on already-locked rows, enabling concurrent processing.
```

---

### 10. Write for Your Audience

Your thesis will be read by:
- **Academic advisors**: Expect theoretical grounding and proper methodology
- **Technical evaluators**: Want to see technical depth and best practices
- **Future students**: May use your work as reference

**Balance is key:** Provide enough detail for technical readers while remaining accessible to academic evaluators who may not be deeply technical.

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ 1. Overly Generic Descriptions

**Bad:**
> "The system has a database that stores data."

**Good:**
> "The system employs a MySQL relational database implementing Third Normal Form (3NF) to store business entities including services, transactions, users, and payment records. The schema utilizes foreign key constraints to enforce referential integrity and supports ACID-compliant transactions essential for payment processing."

---

### ❌ 2. Missing Justifications

**Bad:**
> "The system uses React for the frontend."

**Good:**
> "React was selected for the frontend because: (1) its virtual DOM enables efficient real-time UI updates essential for queue management displays, (2) component-based architecture promotes code reusability across multiple user interfaces, and (3) extensive ecosystem support provides battle-tested solutions for common challenges."

---

### ❌ 3. Diagram Without Context

**Bad:**
```
[Diagram appears with no introduction or explanation]
```

**Good:**
```
The system's data flow follows a standard MVC request-response pattern, 
illustrated in Figure 3.2:

[DIAGRAM]

Figure 3.2: HTTP Request-Response Data Flow

As shown in Figure 3.2, the controller receives user input (1), invokes 
the appropriate model methods (2-3), which interact with the database...
```

---

### ❌ 4. Technology Name Dropping

**Bad:**
> "The system uses Flask, MySQL, Socket.IO, SQLAlchemy, and Eventlet."

**Good:**
> "The application tier is built on Flask 3.0.3, a Python micro-framework chosen for its lightweight nature and flexibility. Flask-SocketIO 5.3.6 extends Flask with WebSocket support, enabling real-time bidirectional communication. The data tier uses MySQL for ACID-compliant storage, accessed through SQLAlchemy 2.0.31 ORM for database-agnostic queries. Eventlet 0.35.2 provides non-blocking I/O for handling concurrent WebSocket connections."

---

### ❌ 5. Implementation Details Instead of Architecture

**Bad (Too Low-Level for Architecture Section):**
> "The login function checks if the username matches the database record using a SELECT query, then uses bcrypt to hash the password and compare it with the stored hash. If it matches, a token is generated using UUID4 and stored in the database."

**Good (Appropriate for Architecture):**
> "The authentication system implements token-based authentication with password hashing. Upon successful credential verification, the system generates a session token stored server-side, which clients include in subsequent requests for authorization. Passwords are hashed using Werkzeug's bcrypt-compatible algorithm with automatic salt generation, ensuring secure credential storage."

---

### ❌ 6. Ignoring Security and Performance

Don't forget to address:
- How sensitive data is protected
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Performance optimization strategies
- Concurrency handling

---

### ❌ 7. Inconsistent Terminology

**Bad:**
```
First paragraph: "The customer module..."
Second paragraph: "The client component..."
Third paragraph: "The user service..."
```

**Solution:** Choose terminology early and use it consistently throughout.

---

### ❌ 8. No Flow or Workflow Descriptions

Architecture isn't just static components—show how they interact!

Include:
- Sequence diagrams for key workflows
- Data flow diagrams
- State transition diagrams

---

## Additional Tips for Success

### 1. Iterative Refinement

Your first draft won't be perfect. Plan for multiple iterations:
- **Draft 1**: Get all content down
- **Draft 2**: Refine structure and organization
- **Draft 3**: Improve language and add justifications
- **Draft 4**: Add/refine diagrams
- **Final**: Proofread for grammar, consistency, technical accuracy

### 2. Get Feedback Early

Share your architecture section with:
- Your thesis advisor
- Technical peers or colleagues
- Other students who have completed their thesis

### 3. Balance Detail and Brevity

**Too Little Detail:**
> "The system uses a database."

**Too Much Detail:**
> "The database connection is established on line 23 of app.py using the pymysql.connect() function with parameters host='localhost', port=3306, user='root'..."

**Just Right:**
> "The system employs MySQL as the relational database, accessed through SQLAlchemy ORM for database-agnostic operations and automatic SQL injection prevention."

### 4. Cross-Reference Other Sections

Your System Architecture should connect to:
- **Chapter 2 (Literature Review)**: Reference architectural patterns discussed
- **Chapter 4 (Implementation)**: Preview what will be detailed later
- **Chapter 5 (Testing)**: Mention how architecture supports testing

### 5. Use Real Examples from Your Code

When describing components, reference actual files:
- "The authentication module (`app/auth.py`)"
- "Socket.IO event handlers are defined in `socketio_events.py`"

This shows your architecture is implemented, not just theoretical.

### 6. Address "Why Not X?" Questions

Preemptively address why you didn't choose popular alternatives:

> "While microservices architecture offers superior scalability, a monolithic three-tier architecture was selected due to: (1) the moderate scale of operations (single spa location), (2) reduced deployment complexity, and (3) simplified development with a small team."

### 7. Highlight Unique Contributions

If your architecture has unique or innovative aspects, emphasize them:
- Novel integration patterns
- Creative solutions to specific problems
- Optimizations for your particular use case

### 8. Write the Summary First

After completing your section, write the summary. Then go back and ensure your introduction matches your summary. They should form bookends around your content.

---

## Reference Format for Technologies

When mentioning technologies, use this format the first time:

**Format:** `[Name] [Version]` (if version is relevant)

**Examples:**
- Flask 3.0.3
- MySQL 8.0
- React 18.2.0
- Socket.IO JavaScript client library

For well-known patterns, cite their source:

**Example:**
> "The system implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, originally described by Reenskaug (1979) and widely adopted in web application development."

---

## Final Thoughts

Writing a strong System Architecture section requires:

1. **Technical Understanding**: Deep knowledge of your system
2. **Communication Skills**: Ability to explain complex concepts clearly
3. **Academic Rigor**: Following formal standards and conventions
4. **Visual Literacy**: Creating effective diagrams
5. **Critical Thinking**: Justifying design decisions

Remember: Your goal is to demonstrate that you understand not just WHAT your system does, but WHY it's designed that way and HOW the components work together.

**Quality over Quantity**: A concise, well-structured 15-page architecture section is far superior to a rambling 30-page section.

**Iterate and Refine**: Plan for multiple drafts and incorporate feedback.

**Stay Consistent**: Use consistent terminology, formatting, and notation throughout.
