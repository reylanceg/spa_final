## Key Changes Made

### ❌ Removed from Conceptual Framework

| Content Type | Example | Reason |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| **Technology Names** | "Flask, MySQL, Socket.IO" | Too implementation-specific |
| **Code Examples** | `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` | Belongs in architecture/modules |
| **File Paths** | `app/routes/customer.py` | Implementation detail |
| **HTTP Endpoints** | `POST /customer/confirm_selection` | Belongs in DFD section |
| **Configuration** | Database connection strings | Belongs in architecture |
| **Room Names** | `therapist_queue`, `cashier_queue` | Implementation detail |
| **SQL Queries** | Full query syntax | Belongs in architecture |

### ✅ Kept in Conceptual Framework

| Content Type | Example | Reason |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| **Theoretical Foundations** | MVC pattern (Krasner & Pope, 1988) | Core to conceptual framework |
| **Architectural Paradigms** | Three-tier client-server | Conceptual design decision |
| **High-Level Components** | Presentation, Application, Data layers | Abstract architecture |
| **IPO Model** | Input → Process → Output | Conceptual data flow |
| **Design Principles** | Separation of concerns, loose coupling | Theoretical justification |
| **Academic References** | Citations to Gamma et al., Gray, etc. | Required for academic rigor |

## Specific Examples of Changes

### Example 1: Component Description

**Before (Too Specific)**:
```
Component 2: Application Layer
Purpose: Business rules and request processing
Technology: Python, Flask, Flask-SocketIO, SQLAlchemy
Relationships: Receives requests from Presentation; queries Data Layer
```

**After (Appropriately Abstract)**:
```
Component 2: Application Layer
Purpose: Business rules and request processing
Responsibilities: Request validation, business logic execution, response generation
Relationships: Receives requests from Presentation; queries Data Layer; broadcasts 
events; enforces authentication
```

**Relocated To**: Section 3.3 (System Architecture) with full technology details

---

### Example 2: Data Flow

**Before (Too Detailed)**:
```
Flow 1: Customer Service Selection
1. Customer confirms → HTTP POST `/customer/confirm_selection`
2. Server validates → Creates Transaction + TransactionItem records
3. Server commits → Generates unique transaction code
4. Server emits event → Broadcasts to `therapist_queue` room
```

**After (Conceptual Only)**:
```
[Kept in IPO Model section as high-level process flow]
INPUT: User service selections
PROCESS: Validation, transaction creation, queue insertion
OUTPUT: Transaction record, queue notification
```

**Relocated To**: Section 3.4 (Data Flow Diagram) with full endpoint details

---

### Example 3: Architectural Paradigm

**Before (Implementation-Focused)**:
```
MVC Pattern
- Model (`models.py`): Business entities
- View (`templates/`): Jinja2 templates
- Controller (`routes/`): Flask blueprints
```

**After (Theory-Focused)**:
```
MVC Pattern
Theoretical Foundation: Introduced by Reenskaug (1979)
Conceptual Application:
- Model: Business entities representing domain concepts
- View: User interface templates for data presentation
- Controller: Request handlers coordinating between Model and View
Benefits: Independent UI evolution, reusable models, enhanced testability
```

**Relocated To**: Section 3.3 (System Architecture) with file structure details

## Questions to Consider

1. Does your thesis template require specific subsections in the conceptual framework?
2. Are there any institution-specific requirements for conceptual frameworks?
3. Does your advisor prefer more or less technical detail in the conceptual framework?
4. Should any additional theoretical foundations be included?
