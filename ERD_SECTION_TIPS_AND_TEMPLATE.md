# 3.5 Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) - Tips & Template

## üéØ Academic Writing Tips for ERD Section

### Key Success Factors

1. **Be Comprehensive**: Describe EVERY entity, attribute, and relationship
2. **Be Consistent**: Use same terminology throughout
3. **Be Precise**: Use exact technical terms (Primary Key, Foreign Key, cardinality)
4. **Be Justified**: Explain design decisions and business rules
5. **Be Academic**: Formal tone, third-person, present tense

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Guidelines

### DO ‚úÖ

- **Use present tense**: "The Transaction entity stores customer service requests"
- **Explain business rules**: "This ensures historical pricing accuracy when rates change"
- **Define cardinality clearly**: "One-to-Many (1:N)" or "Many-to-One (N:1)"
- **Explain denormalization**: "Price is stored redundantly to preserve historical accuracy"
- **Reference figures**: "As shown in Figure 3.X, the ERD consists of 10 entities"
- **Use technical terms**: "UNIQUE constraint", "CASCADE DELETE", "referential integrity"
- **Provide examples**: Show sample data for clarity

### DON'T ‚ùå

- **First person**: Avoid "We designed..." or "I created..."
- **Casual language**: No "basically", "just", "simply"
- **Incomplete descriptions**: Don't list attributes without explaining their purpose
- **Missing justifications**: Always explain WHY decisions were made
- **Ignore relationships**: Every foreign key needs explanation

## üìê Standard Entity Description Format

Use this template for EACH of your 10 entities:

```markdown
### 3.5.2.X [EntityName] Entity

**Purpose:**  
[1-2 sentences explaining what this entity represents and why it exists]

**Primary Key:**  
- `attribute_name` (TYPE, CONSTRAINTS): [Brief description]

**Foreign Keys:** _(if applicable)_
- `fk_name` (TYPE, FK ‚Üí ReferencedEntity.attribute): [Purpose of relationship]

**Attributes:**
- `attribute1` (TYPE, CONSTRAINTS): [Description and purpose]
- `attribute2` (TYPE, CONSTRAINTS): [Description and purpose]
- ...

**Business Rules:**
1. [Rule explaining constraint or validation]
2. [Rule explaining business logic]
3. ...

**Relationships:**
- [Relationship type with other entities]

**Example Data:** _(optional but recommended)_
| id | attr1 | attr2 |
|----|-------|-------|
| 1  | value | value |

**Design Rationale:** _(if special considerations exist)_
[Explanation of any denormalization, special constraints, or unusual design choices]
```

---

## üìã Standard Relationship Description Format

For EACH relationship between entities:

```markdown
### 3.5.3.X [Entity1] ‚Üí [Entity2] (Cardinality)

**Cardinality:** [One-to-Many (1:N), Many-to-One (N:1), One-to-One (1:1), Many-to-Many (M:N)]

**Participation:**
- **[Entity1]**: [Mandatory/Optional] participation - [explanation]
- **[Entity2]**: [Mandatory/Optional] participation - [explanation]

**Foreign Key:** `Table.column` references `ReferencedTable.column`

**Referential Integrity Action:** [CASCADE DELETE / SET NULL / RESTRICT DELETE]

**Business Justification:**  
[Explain why this relationship exists and what business requirement it supports]

**Example:**
[Show concrete example with sample data]
```

## üé® Writing Style Examples

### Example 1: Entity Purpose (Good vs. Bad)

**‚ùå BAD:**
> "This table stores services."

**‚úÖ GOOD:**
> "The Service entity defines individual spa service offerings available for customer selection, including service descriptions and categorization. Each service represents a distinct treatment option with multiple pricing/duration variants."

---

### Example 2: Attribute Description (Good vs. Bad)

**‚ùå BAD:**
> "- code: unique transaction number"

**‚úÖ GOOD:**
> "- `code` (VARCHAR(4), UNIQUE, NOT NULL): Sequential 4-digit transaction identifier (e.g., '0001', '0002') displayed to customers for reference. Generated via TransactionCounter entity to ensure uniqueness and provide user-friendly format."

---

### Example 3: Business Rule (Good vs. Bad)

**‚ùå BAD:**
> "Username must be unique."

**‚úÖ GOOD:**
> "Username must be unique across all therapist accounts to prevent authentication conflicts. The UNIQUE constraint at database level ensures no duplicate usernames can be created, even under concurrent registration attempts."

---

### Example 4: Relationship Description (Good vs. Bad)

**‚ùå BAD:**
> "Transaction has many items."

**‚úÖ GOOD:**
> "The Transaction entity maintains a One-to-Many relationship with TransactionItem, where each transaction contains one or more service line items. This design implements a shopping cart model, enabling customers to select multiple services in a single visit while maintaining itemized tracking for receipt generation and service analytics."

---

## üîç Special Topics to Address

### 1. Denormalization Justification

Your TransactionItem entity stores `price` and `duration_minutes` redundantly. Explain this:

```
**Controlled Denormalization:**

TransactionItem intentionally stores price and duration_minutes (data that also 
exists in ServiceClassification) to preserve historical accuracy. While this 
violates strict Third Normal Form, it is essential for business requirements:

**Scenario:** Customer books 90-minute massage for ‚Ç±700 in January.
**Future Change:** Spa increases price to ‚Ç±800 in February.
**Result:** January transaction permanently displays ‚Ç±700 (historical accuracy).

Without denormalization, past transactions would retroactively show current 
prices, causing discrepancies in financial reports and customer records.
```

### 2. Enum Status Values

Transaction status is an ENUM with 8 values. Explain the workflow:

```
**Status ENUM Values:**

The Transaction.status attribute uses an enumerated type to enforce valid 
state values and prevent invalid data entry. The eight states represent the 
complete service lifecycle:

1. `selecting`: Customer browsing (not yet confirmed)
2. `pending_therapist`: Confirmed, awaiting therapist assignment
3. `therapist_confirmed`: Therapist assigned, preparing room
4. `in_service`: Service delivery in progress
5. `finished`: Service complete, awaiting payment
6. `awaiting_payment`: Cashier assigned, entering payment amount
7. `paying`: Payment processing in progress
8. `paid`: Transaction complete, cycle finished

State transitions follow strict workflow rules enforced at application layer.
```

### 3. Authentication Security

Therapist and Cashier store hashed passwords. Explain security:

```
**Password Security:**

The password_hash attribute stores passwords using Werkzeug's 
`generate_password_hash()` function, which implements the PBKDF2-SHA256 
algorithm with automatic salt generation. This approach ensures:

1. **Irreversibility**: Original passwords cannot be recovered from hashes
2. **Salt Protection**: Unique salt per password prevents rainbow table attacks
3. **Computational Cost**: Adaptive hashing with configurable work factors 
   resists brute-force attacks even as hardware improves
4. **Compliance**: Meets OWASP password storage guidelines

Plain-text passwords are never stored in the database, protecting user 
credentials even in the event of data breach.
```

## ‚ö° Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Write Overview (15 minutes)
- Introduce ERD concept
- State normalization approach (3NF)
- List 10 entities organized by domain
- Reference your ERD figure

### Step 2: Describe Entities (90 minutes = ~9 min per entity)
For EACH entity, write:
1. Purpose (why it exists)
2. Primary key explanation
3. Foreign keys (if any)
4. All attributes with data types and constraints
5. Business rules (2-4 rules minimum)
6. Relationships overview
7. Example data (optional)

**Order:** Start with simple entities (ServiceCategory), end with complex (Transaction)

### Step 3: Describe Relationships (60 minutes)
For EACH of 10 relationships:
1. State cardinality clearly
2. Explain participation (mandatory/optional)
3. Identify foreign key
4. State referential action (CASCADE, SET NULL, RESTRICT)
5. Justify business need
6. Provide example

### Step 4: Normalization Analysis (20 minutes)
- Confirm 1NF, 2NF, 3NF compliance
- Explain intentional denormalization (TransactionItem)
- Justify design decisions

### Step 5: Integrity Constraints (20 minutes)
- Entity integrity (PRIMARY KEY)
- Referential integrity (FOREIGN KEY)
- Domain integrity (NOT NULL, CHECK, ENUM)
- User-defined (UNIQUE constraints, business rules)

**Total Time: ~3 hours**

## üìù Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **‚ùå Listing attributes without explanation**
   - Don't just write: "id, name, price"
   - Explain each attribute's purpose and constraints

2. **‚ùå Ignoring nullable attributes**
   - If attribute is NULL-able, explain why
   - Example: "therapist_id is nullable because assignment occurs after creation"

3. **‚ùå Forgetting audit timestamps**
   - Your Transaction has 7 timestamps - explain their audit trail purpose

4. **‚ùå Not explaining UNIQUE constraints**
   - Transaction.code is UNIQUE - explain the business reason

5. **‚ùå Skipping CASCADE implications**
   - If you use CASCADE DELETE, explain what gets deleted and why

6. **‚ùå Missing cardinality notation**
   - Always state: "One-to-Many (1:N)" not just "has many"

7. **‚ùå Incomplete relationship descriptions**
   - For each FK, explain the business reason for the relationship
